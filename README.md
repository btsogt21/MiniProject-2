# MiniProject-2
Creating and Comparing LinkedList to ArrayList

In this mini-project I go about implementing a LinkedList and an ArrayList in Java using IntelliJ. The LinkedList and the ArrayList both implement a List Interface.

The CreateList and TestList files are there to create sequences of list operations as a text file and test them out on both the LinkedList and the ArrayList to ensure that they are
functioning as intended.

When CreateList is ran, it reads 3 arguments from the Command Line, the first of which is the number of list operations to include in the sequence text,
the second of which is the seed for the randomizer, and the third of which is the name of the text file that will be generated. 

When TestList is ran, it reads 2 arguments from the Command Line, the first of which is which of 'MyArrayList' and 'MyLinkedList' you would like to test, and the second of which
is the name of the text file containing list-operations.
